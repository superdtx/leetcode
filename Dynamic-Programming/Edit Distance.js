/*
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
 */

/*
This is a classic problem of Dynamic Programming. We define the state dp[i][j] to be the minimum number of operations to convert word1[0..i - 1] to word2[0..j - 1]. The state equations have two cases: the boundary case and the general case. Note that in the above notations, both i and j take values starting from 1.

For the boundary case, that is, to convert a string to an empty string, it is easy to see that the mininum number of operations to convert word1[0..i - 1] to "" requires at least i operations (deletions). In fact, the boundary case is simply:

dp[i][0] = i;
dp[0][j] = j.
Now let's move on to the general case, that is, convert a non-empty word1[0..i - 1] to another non-empty word2[0..j - 1]. Well, let's try to break this problem down into smaller problems (sub-problems). Suppose we have already known how to convert word1[0..i - 2] to word2[0..j - 2], which is dp[i - 1][j - 1]. Now let's consider word[i - 1] and word2[j - 1]. If they are euqal, then no more operation is needed and dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]. Well, what if they are not equal?

If they are not equal, we need to consider three cases:

Replace word1[i - 1] by word2[j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 (for replacement));
Delete word1[i - 1] and word1[0..i - 2] = word2[0..j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1 (for deletion));
Insert word2[j - 1] to word1[0..i - 1] and word1[0..i - 1] + word2[j - 1] = word2[0..j - 1] (dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1 (for insertion)).
Make sure you understand the subtle differences between the equations for deletion and insertion. For deletion, we are actually converting word1[0..i - 2] to word2[0..j - 1], which costs dp[i - 1][j], and then deleting the word1[i - 1], which costs 1. The case is similar for insertion.

Putting these together, we now have:

dp[i][0] = i;
dp[0][j] = j;
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1], if word1[i - 1] = word2[j - 1];
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1), otherwise.
The above state equations can be turned into the following code directly.

var minDistance = function(word1, word2) {
    var m = word1.length;
    var n = word2.length;
    
    if(m === 0) return n;
    if(n === 0) return m;
    
    var table = new Array(m+1).fill([]);
    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
      table[i] = new Array(n+1);
    }
    
    for(let i = 0; i <= m; i++) table[i][0] = i;
    for(let j = 0; j <= n; j++) table[0][j] = j;

    for(let i = 1; i <= m; i++){
        for(let j = 1; j <= n; j++){
            var cost = (word1[i-1] === word2[j-1] ? 0 : 1);
            table[i][j] = Math.min(table[i-1][j]+1, table[i][j-1]+1, table[i-1][j-1]+cost);
        }
    }
    
    return table[m][n];
};
